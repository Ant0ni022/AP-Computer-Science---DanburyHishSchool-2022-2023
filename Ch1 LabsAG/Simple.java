         * 1. simple (Why do you even have to change the name of the file in this case?)
         * It does compile but for easy understanding program names should always start with Upper case letter
         * 2. SimpleProgram
         * Does also Compile but again for easy understanding its recommended to no have upper case
         * letter besides the first word naming the program
         * 3. 1 Simple
         * It modify the program in which a error appear saying that before the "1" it should have
         * a identifier
         * 4. _Simple_
         * It does compile with no error
         * 5. *Simple*
         * It does not compile and the same error appear as number 3, because of the "*"
         * the program expects a identifier infront of it
         * 6. $123_45
         * It does compile with no error
         * 7. Simple!
         * It does not compile and show a error saying it expected a "{" meaning 
         * either a bigging or ending of code
